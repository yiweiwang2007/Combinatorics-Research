This research explores tiling problems on hexagonal boards using triangular and trapezoidal tiles. Starting with a connection to the Fibonacci sequence in linear tilings, the project extends to more complex structures using combinatorial casework, breakability conditions, and recursive subdivision.

We define a new recursive sequence, T(n), based on the number of tilings for subdivided triangular boards. This sequence has been published in the OEIS as A365352. Recursive formulas are derived for various board shapes, and connections are made to Narayana's Cow sequence to model unbreakable cases more efficiently.

The study contributes to the understanding of recursive structures in tiling and combinatorics, with potential applications in algorithmic design and sequence generation.
